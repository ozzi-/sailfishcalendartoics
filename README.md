# SFCALTOICS
Export SailfishOS calendar (sqlite database) to one ICS file!

Supports start / end, descriptions, timezones, birthdays. Not so sure about other reoccuring events though. 
Send me a DB containing some special usecases so i can implement them.

1. Copy home/nemo/.local/share/system/privileged/Calendar/mkcal to your computer
2. java -jar sfcaltoics.jar "C:\Path\To\db" "C:\Path\To\Save\ics"(optional)
3. Import ICS in your software of choice
